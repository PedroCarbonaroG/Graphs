# Graphs - Algorithms and data structure Repository

This repository is dedicated to the "Graphs - Algorithms and data structure Repository" project.

## Project Overview

### Project Description
Comprehensive collection of graph algorithms and data structures for efficient graph manipulation and analysis.

#### Key Features:
- Efficient implementations of classic graph algorithms such as breadth-first search, depth-first search, and Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Optimized data structures including graph representations (adjacency matrix, adjacency list) and priority queue implementations.
- Support for various types of graphs including directed, undirected, weighted, and unweighted.

## Code Structure

The codebase is meticulously organized for efficiency, featuring modular design, thorough comments, rigorous testing, and optimal algorithm implementations.

#### Repository Folders:
- `src`: Contains the source code of the Graphs project
- `resources`: Contains files for test and the original one for the system

## Usage

Explore the `src` folder to delve into the complete source code of the Graphs project. Each class and package is meticulously organized to facilitate a clear understanding of the project structure.
